# Card Types: 
Character Cards:
Limit 5 on the Floor at a time. No summon limit per turn except BOH cost. Check BOH cost and tap equivalent BOH cards in your BOH Zone to play.  Opponents have an opportunity to respond to summoning.

Cannot attack when tapped. Some tap to use abilities. Untap during Commercial Planning Phase.


Spell Cards:
No limit per turn except BOH cost. Check BOH cost and tap equivalent BOH cards in your BOH Zone to play. Once played, declare target(s) if any. Keep on Floor until the Closing Phase. During the Closing Phase, remove the card from the Floor and place it in the discard pile. If a Spell Card is played without a target, it resolves, and is sent to the Discard Pile.

Fashion Items:
No limit per turn except BOH cost. Check BOH cost and tap equivalent BOH cards in your BOH Zone to play. Unless specified, can only be equipped to ally Characters. Can be tapped if the card specifies. Untap during Commercial Planning Phase. If a Fashion item is played without a target, it resolves, and is sent to the Discard Pile. Hesitantly: 1 Fashion Item per Character.


Summons:
IDK, maybe extra deck with specific tribute/fusion/xyz Character card requirements. 


# Win Condition:
The win condition is to attack an opponent when they no longer have any T&A cards left in their T&A Zone

# Turn Layout-Phases: 

# Draw Phase:
Draw a card unless first turn.
# Commercial Planning Phase:
“Untap” all BOH cards. 
# BOH Phase:
Once per turn, players can place any 1 card into the BOH Zone. Cards cost different amounts of BOH. If you want to play a card, you must “tap” one or more of your BOH cards in order to play it. “Tapping” involves turning your BOH card sideways. 
# Opening Phase: 
Opening phase is for using your BOH to play cards, whether they be character cards, spells, or equip items. You can play as many cards as you want if you have the BOH cards to support the cost. When playing spells or equip items, if necessary, targets must be declared. When you are done playing cards in your Opening Phase, you must declare you’re moving into the Attack/Floor Phase.
	
### Countering:
Anytime you play something, your opponent has a chance to counter. You can also counter their counter which will be talked about in the Stack section. When playing a counter, target(s) must be declared.

# Floor Phase: 
During this phase, you may play as many cards as you want. When you run out of BOH, or you are finished playing cards, you may move to the Attack Phase.

# Attack Phase:
If an opposing player has a character card on their field, it must be attacked before you can attack their T&A zone. You can declare your target(s) if the opposing player has multiple character cards on the board. 
## Attacking:
When attacking, declare one of the Character card’s base stats to attack with; Loyalty, Truck, or Garment Care. (In general, whichever one is the highest) 
Your opponent must then defend your attack with the same stat on their character card. Whoever has the highest stat at the resolution of the Stack (see Stacks section) wins. 
(For more information, see the Combat System section)
## Countering:
Anytime you play something, your opponent has a chance to counter. You can also counter their counter which will be talked about in the Stack section. When playing a counter, target(s) must be declared.

## T&A Damage:
In general, whoever has the highest declared stat wins. No battle damage is done. Direct attacks are the only way to hurt an opponent. When declaring a direct attack, no attack stat must be declared. Attacking player chooses a T&A zone card on their opponent’s side of the field. Card is then revealed to both players, and the targeted player can choose to either add the card to their hand or to play the card without “tapping” any BOH cards. If the T&A card is a Spell, if it has any casting requirements, they are ignored. Cards played after a T&A attack can still be countered which is discussed in the Stack.
	
# Closing Phase: 
Closing phase is for using your BOH to play cards, whether they be character cards, spells, or equip items. You can play as many cards as you want if you have the BOH to support it. When playing spells or equip items, if necessary, targets must be declared. 
## Countering:
Anytime you play something, your opponent has a chance to counter. You can also counter their counter which will be talked about in the Stack section. When playing a counter, target(s) must be declared.

# Stack:
The Stack is a classic layout of card game mechanics. Whenever a card is played or an action is declared, it is put on the stack. If no response card or action is played, the card “resolves”. However, a card or action played after that card in response to it is then put on top of it. These cards then “resolve” in reverse order. This is why it is called the Stack. 

### Example 1:
Say that I declare an attack with my Sean character card, but my opponent plays a card that reduces all of his stats by 10. 

The Stack currently looks like this, with the left side being what is played first.

Stack = [(“Sean”, attacks, target “Kevin”, Loyalty), (“Karen Complains”, Reduce all stats by 10, target Sean)]

In order of resolution, the stat reduction will resolve first, making the stats look like this.

Stack = [(“Sean”, attacks with -10 stats)]

At this point, the attack with Sean would resolve. You cannot play cards in between stacks. A card can only be played in response to another card.

### Example 2:
If you wanted to counter the -10 debuff, you would have to play a counterspell after your opponent declared their -10. This would make the Stack look like this:

Stack = [(“Sean”, attacks), (“Karen Complains”, Reduce all stats by 10, target Sean), (“HOD”, Counterspell, target “Karen Complains”)]

Counterspells have to declare a target, so the “HOD” card would counter the “Karen Complains” card. If no card is played in response, the stack resolves in reverse order and you end up with this. 
Nothing is played in response:
Stack = [(“Sean”, attacks), (“Karen Complains”, Reduce all stats by 10, target Sean), (“HOD”, Counterspell, target “Karen Complains”)]

“HOD” Resolves:
Stack = [(“Sean”, attacks), (“Karen Complains”, Reduce all stats by 10, target Sean, countered by “HOD”)]

“Karen Complains” Resolves:
Stack = [(“Sean”, attacks)]

Finally, Sean’s Attack Resolves:
Stack = [ ]

# Combat System:
(Mechanics section)
Players must announce their actions to their opponent.
Unless specified on a card, a player must declare a target of an ability when playing a card.

## Battle Mechanics:
* Base stats:
    Loyalty - how good a Character is at loyalty
    Truck - how good a character is at truck
    Garment Care -how good a character is at garment care

* Stress Level:
All Characters have a unique Stress Level. More powerful characters have a higher Stress Level. When a Character’s Stress Level is/reaches 80, their Base Stats are decreased by 5. For every increment of 5 above 80, their Base Stats further decrease by 5. When their Stress Level reaches 100, they cannot attack. Stress can increase past 100. 

* Declaration Phase:
When battling, the attacking player declares a Character to attack with and taps it. Attacking player then declares a target and which base stat to attack with. 

* Battle Phase:
The Defending player must then compare their Character’s stat of the type that was declared and compare it to the attacking player's declared stat. The higher of the two wins the battle.  After the declaration of the attack, the opposing player has a chance to respond. If no response is given, the attacking player is given a chance to respond. If neither player chooses to respond, the attack resolves. If one of the players chooses to respond, the Stack is initiated. When the stack resolves, the attack resolves. 

* Resolution Phase: 
Loser of the battle is removed from the field. 

### Direct attacks:
* Declaration Phase:
When attacking Directly, the attacking player declares a Character to attack with and taps it. Attacking Player then declares the target T&A Card(s). If the Defending Player can cast any Spells, they can do so and the Stack begins. 

* Resolution Phase:
The Defending player flips over targeted T&A Card(s) and reveals the card(s) to their opponent. They can then choose whether to play the card(s) for free without tapping BOH Cards or add the card(s) to their hand.
